# Movie_Script 

## Code Review

**Find errors in the code (syntax, logic or otherwise) and suggest fixes**

The first script had poor documentation/logic and had some typos. 
Most importantly, the script did not include actual Python functions. 
I updated the script to actually include functions. 
I also limited the documentation to what the code does and removed anything that would otherwise be explained in the README. 

**Highlight great things in the code**

I looked at example Github scripts scrapping IMDB's site and it was intimidating if I'm being frank. I hope to get my skills to that level on day. 
My code is still very basic/novice and needs a lot of work. 
I still require more work/practice getting down basic concepts - thankfully I'll have free time during winter break.  

**Bring up any concerns about naming conventions or structure**

I believe the naming conventions make sense. I tried to name everything relative to its purpose. 

**Ask questions if you don’t understand the approach or it doesn’t follow the logic you would use. (You might learn something new!)**

I wondered if "findall()" would have made sense to use but had a hard time figuring out how to code something relevant. 
I know this script could use a lot of different and more advanced approaches.
